# Rental Coding Challenge
The solution to this [challenge](https://github.com/mathew-fleisch/rental-coding-challenge) was written in PHP and Javascript. It is temporarily hosted on my [website](http://mathewfleisch.com/rental-coding-challenge) and the source on github; once the interview process is over, I will remove these sources. I developed two views to showcase the application within the [branded website](http://mathewfleisch.com/rental-coding-challenge/rental-calculator.php) framework, and another that [highlights the underlying code](http://mathewfleisch.com/rental-coding-challenge), with default styling. Both the styled and stand-alone versions are mobile responsive and use Bootstrap as a base. 

## Instructions
 - Click & Drag the Bedroom/Bathroom sliders or type the value within the corresponding text-box until they match the desired values. Pressing the up/down keys in the text-boxes will also make the slider values increase/decrease.
 - If no square-footage is entered, the average price of that category is displayed in "suggested price" section, by default. Entering a square-footage for the unit will adjust the price up or down, limited to the min/max values for that category.
 - If further context is required, the "rental data" section will automatically show the relevant data for that category. Clicking the "show all" button will display the statistics for all categories. 
 - To see the suggested price for the four sample units for sale, click the buttons above the calculator to quickly toggle between the different values.

## Notes
If I were to do this again I would use a front-end framework like AngularJS to accomplish the same task.
